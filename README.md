# Easy50Hours, Code4Good project
##### *This was a 3 months long project organized for highschool students by Epam Systems where team of fours  had to compete with eachouther by making a great website. The topic is one of the aspirations of the United Nations Organization* 
## The goal of the project
* The **Easy50Hours** website was a tool for the bigger picture. It would have helped hungarian students to complete their obligated 50 hours of work not at a non-profit organization, but rather at an individual.

* At the same time anyone would have been able to delegate their work such as housekeeping to a student in return of certified work hours. 

* The real world application of the project came with a bunch of legal issues and thus, it was abbandoned after the final presentation of the site.
## Retrospective
I learned a lot about web and general development. Looking back I can identify my mistakes such as:

* Not keeping the code organized and not having a system for it.
* Not looking for pre-baked solutions for common tasks, but trying to come up with everything on my own.
* Trying to be the superhero of the team doing everything by myself rather than helping them get even more involved to the point where we could have worked side-by-side.
